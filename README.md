# Spatial Shrooms Project

The main goal of this project is to use spatial data to gather a better idea on where to find all the mushrooms a mycophile could ever want. No mushrooms in particular, I just enjoy finding and cataloging them in iNatualist,so we will use this as the base dataset. A simple approach is to just overlay all the observations on a map, but I want to take it a few steps further by integrating in soil data, NAIP immagery, lidar, and anything else that might be predective.
